# Car dealership shop/forum

**Console application school project made with C and SQL**  
The application acts as and has the functionality of a basic car dealership or shop/forum

Because I use PostgreSQL the C library "libpq-fe.h" is aslo required.  
The user can view all the content of the tables and also to add new data and change the tables according to set restrictions.  
There are 4 tables - [Brands, Cars, Owners, History](https://github.com/siimtishler/CarDealerShip/blob/main/SQL_TABLES_carDealerShip.txt)

The user can navigate the dealership with a Console menu shown in the picture
